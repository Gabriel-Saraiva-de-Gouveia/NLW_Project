# Barcode Generator Project

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the NLW (Next Level Week) event by Rocketseat. The primary goal of the project is to generate barcode images dynamically from provided product codes through a POST request. This functionality proves to be valuable for inventory management systems, allowing users to generate on-the-fly barcode labels for new products.

## Features

- **Barcode Generation:** Accepts a product code via a POST request and generates a Code128 format barcode image.

- **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling and input validations to ensure smooth operation.

- **Path Response:** The server responds with the path to the saved barcode image file after successful generation.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for Python.

- **Barcode Library:** Utilizes the python-barcode library for generating barcode images.

## Best Practices and Learning

Throughout the development process, this project adheres to best practices in software development. It includes:

- **Good Development Practices:** Follows coding standards, organizational patterns, and clean code principles.

- **Error Handling:** Implements effective error handling to enhance the reliability of the application.

- **Input Validation:** Incorporates data input validation to ensure the security and integrity of the system.

- **Unit Testing:** Demonstrates knowledge of unit testing for code verification and validation.

- **Project Structure:** Organizes the project following good architecture and design patterns.
